3 Tier architecture:

    [Presentation]
          |
    [Application]
          |
      [Database]--(RDBMS)

    Presentation layer:
        Consists of the user interface.
        Runs on the client machine.
        Uses a standard Graphical User Interface:
            Web browser
            SAP GUI
        Supports various devices (PCs, smartphones, ...) and OS environments.
        Communication with application layer:
            Takes iser inputs.
            Send requests to application server.
            Display the results received.

    Application layer:
        Where all the major work is done by ABAP programs.
        Hosts modules of business functions and executes program codes.
        It can consist of multiple application servers and a messaging server.
        Applications executions take place in the application layer.
        Communication with database to process data requested by user.

    Database layer:
        Where all persistent data is stored.
        Is typically managed by a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS):
            Provides declarative method to maintain data and queries.
            And the system takes cares of describing the structures for storing data.
            Data is stored in one or more Tables:
                Rows and columns are identified by unique key.
                Tables are related with foreign keys.
        Supported databases:
            SAP HANA
            Oracle
            MSSQL
            MaxDB
            IBM DB/2
