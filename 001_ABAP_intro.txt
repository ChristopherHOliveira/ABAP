ABAP:
    Is a programming language used to develop applications in SAP systems.
    ABAP (Allgemeiner Berichts Aufbereitungs Prozessor) means 'General Report-Consolidating Processor'
    'Processador de Criação de Relatórios Gerais', and an acronym for 'Advanced Business Application Programming'.
    Different from other languages, ABAP was specifically developed to be used only in SAP systems.

Role of an ABAP Consultant:
    Despite a good understanding of the business processes helps to code, it isn't absolutely necessary.
    As ABAP devs, we don't usually interact with end users directly.
    
    Functional consultants valuate the customer requirement and decide if it requires technical changes.
    If so, the functional Center of Excelence (CoE) assign a task to the ABAP CoE:
        Functional consultant:
            Prepare a functional requirement document explaining the requirement and listing
            all the essential information to make the changes needed in the application.
                e.g. User asks for some extra information to be shown in a report output:
                        the functional specification will provide the required information, such as:
                        name of the report
                        program that should be changed
                        database tables where the extra information can be found to show in the report output.
    Functional specification Received by the ABAP CoE is assigned to an ABAP consultant.
        ABAB consultant:
            Prepare a technical specification based on the functional specification:
                The technical specification capture the required changes from a technical perspective
            Make the necessary changes to the application.
            The application will be tested by the functional consultant and user in Quality Assurance environment.

    Changing and Adapting Data Structure
        SAP software is delivered with standard SAP applications and configurations.
        However, every company may have its company-specific requirements:
            This is called 'customization'. There are 3 types:
                Modification:
                    Standard SAP is modified.
                    Modifications are lost when system is upgraded or support package is imported
                Customer enhancement:
                    Standard SAP applications are enhanced without changing the standard source code.
                    There are specific openings in the code where you can supplement the SAP standard system.
                        The enhancements aren't lost in a system upgrade.
                    SAP provides a variety of enhancements techniques:
                        User Exits / Customer Exits
                        Business Add-Ins (BAdIs)
                        ...
                    Not every standard SAP object can be enhanced.
                Customer development:
                    Customers develop own repository objects:
                        Tables
                        Programs
                        Transactions
                        ...
                    All objects created by a customer should start with Y or Z.
