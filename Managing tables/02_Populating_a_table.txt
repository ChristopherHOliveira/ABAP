Three basic example ways to populate a table:

1. Go to SE16n:
        Type the table name in 'table to be searched' and press f8.
        Insert a row if you have permission.

2. If you don't have permission to add new lines, in SE16n:
        Type the table name in 'table to be searched'.
        Type '/h' in the SAP GUI command field and press f8. It will enter the debug mode.
            In 'Variables 1' tab, type the 'GD-EDIT' variable and set its value to 'X'.
            Also set the 'GD-SAPEDIT' variable value to 'X'.
            Now the buttons to add new lines in the table will be available.

3. Create a program with a selection screen in which the user can add data.
