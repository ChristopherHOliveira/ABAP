SAP:
    'Systeme, Anwendungen und Produkte in der Datenverarbeitung' or 'Systems, Applications and Products in data processing'.
    SAP systems are used by enterprises to take care of all of its business related processes.
    
    There are many SAP products (e.g. CRM, BI, HR, PLM, SCM, ...) but the mostly known is 'SAP ERP' or 'SAP ECC'.
    Understanding how an SAP ERP system woks is vital to understanding ABAP programming.

    SAP ECC/ERP' Full name:
        SAP
        ERP  (Enterprise Resource Planning)
        ECC  (Enterprise Central Component)
        X.X  (Version)
        EhPX (Enhancement Package)

Typical business activities:
    SALES department
        Captures customer orders
    MATERIALS
        Procures raw materials from diffenent vendors, based on the order
    PRODUCTION
        Manufacture or assemble the product from the raw materials
    LOGISTICS
        Delivers the product to the customer adress captured while creating the order
    FINANCE
        Manages accounts

    Non-ERP business uses different databases for each department of an organization:
        SALES      - Sales DATABASE
        MATERIALS  - Materials DATABASE
        PRODUCTION - Production DATABASE
        LOGISTICS  - Logistics DATABASE
        FINANCE    - Finance DATABASE

        In this model, all departments rely on information from each other to  complete a business transaction.
        Not in real time.

    ERP software integrates various functions of a business. Typically it implements a common database?
        SALES      - | D    |
        MATERIALS  - | A  B |
        PRODUCTION - | T  A |
        LOGISTICS  - | A  S |
        FINANCE    - |    E |

        Real time data access.
        Enables automation.
            e.g. errors when user enters delivery date that can't be made.
        Accurate delivery update.
        Database consists of thousands of tables, usable by any application.

SAP Modules:
    Are called the business functions in SAP.
    Functional Modules:
        FI - Financial Accounting
        CO - Controlling
        SD - Sales and Distribution
        MM - Materials Management
        HR - Human Resourse
        PM - Plant Maintenance
        PP - Production Planning
        ...

    Technical Modules
        ABAP
        Basis
        BusinessObjects Business Inteligence (BI) / Business Warehouse (BW)
        Exchange Infrastructure (XI) / Process Integration (PI)
        Enterprise Portal
        HANA
        ...

Types of users:
    End users:
        Who use the SAP system in a production environment to carry their day-to-day activities.
    Consultants:
        Subject matter experts who help to customize and maintain SAP systems.
        The consultant's area of expertise determines if he is a functional or a technical one.

Architecture:
    3 tiers.

    [Presentation]
          |
    [Application]
          |
      [Database]--(RDBMS)

    Presentation layer:
        Consists of the user interface.
        Runs on the client machine.
        Uses a standard Graphical User Interface:
            Web browser:
                modern web-based applications.
            SAP GUI:
                classical SAP GUI-based applications.
        Supports various devices (PCs, smartphones, ...) and OS environments.
        Communication with application layer:
            Takes user inputs.
            Send requests to application server for processing.
            Display the formatted output results received.
        Windows OS:
            SAP GUI for Windows.
        Linux/Mac OS:
            SAP GUI for Java.
        Web:
            SAP GUI for HTML:
                Requires the server to run Internet Transaction Server (ITS):
                    Performs one-to-one mapping of SAP screen fields to SAP GUI for HTML.
                Internet Communication Manager (ICM) ensures HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP protocols works propperly.

                _____________________________________________________________SAP GUI

    Application layer:
        Where all the major work is done by ABAP programs.
        Hosts modules of business functions and executes program codes.
        It can consist of:
            Multiple application servers:
                which interprets ABAP programs.
            A messaging server:
                responsable for communication between application servers.
        Applications executions take place in the application layer.
        Communication with database to process data requested by user.

        SAP Netweaver:
            Application server that provides runtime environment for ABAP and Java programs:
                Pure ABAP: limited support for Java.
                Pure Java: doesn't support ABAP applications.
                Dual stack: both

        ABAPers are not directly involved in installation or maintenance of an application server.
            This is role of Basis consultant.
            However understanding the components of application server (and their roles)
                is good for understanding backend processes.

        The components of SAP systems are called instances:
            Each application server can have multiple wor processes,
                but only one ICM, dispatcher, gateway and SAP start service.
            ABAP System Central Services (ASCS):
                Message Server:
                    Load ballance and communication between instances.
                Enqueue Server:
                    Manages application locks (ensures no two users edit the same data at the same time).
                Start server(separated):
            ICM:
                Enables the application server to communicate with the outsid world (HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP).
                It 'web-enables' the application server through a web browser.
                It runs at a separate process, started and monitored by ABAP dispatcher.
                It can process requests from the internet, such as Web Dympro-based.
            ABAP Dispatcher:
                Each application server has a dispatcher. It assign requests to work processes.
                [User request]->[Dispatcher]->[assign request to an available work process]
                    e.g. When user log in to a SAP system, the request goes to a message server
                            which performs load balancing and connects the user to the dispatcher
                            of an instance with the least load.
            SAP Web Dispatcher:
                Lies between the internet and SAP systems.
            Gateway:
                Enables the communication with external systems using Remote Function alls (RFCs):
                    Based on TCP/IP.
                    Can be made in ABAP programs or usung interface of external programs.
                Can be used between processes of an instance.
            SAP start devices:
                Starts,
                monitor the runtime state,
                read logs,
                and stop SAP system instances.
            Work processes:
                User srequests are processed through work processes.
                There may exists multiple per application server.
                [User requests]->[ABAP dispatcher]->[Work Process]
                                 _________________________________Application Server      
                Once the work process completes the requests:
                    it sends back the result,
                    work process becomes free again to take a new request.
                WP are not dedicated to any user or session.

                DIA (dialog)               | Handles dialog requests (made from user screens)
                UPD/UPD2 (update)          | Handles high ans low updates to the database
                BTC (background processing)| Handles Handles background jobs
                SPO (spool)                | Handles spool requests

                    SAP Basis admin can configure the number of work processes for each type.

    Database layer:
        Where all persistent data is stored:
            + application data, admin data, customizing settings, ABAP source code.
        Is typically managed by a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS):
            Provides declarative method to maintain data and queries.
            And the system takes cares of describing the structures for storing data.
            Data is stored in one or more Tables:
                Rows and columns are identified by unique key.
                Tables are related with foreign keys.
        Supported databases:
            SAP HANA
            Oracle
            MSSQL
            IBM DB/2
            SAP liveCache
            SAP MaxDB
            SAP HANA (optimized in SAP NetWeaver 7.5)
