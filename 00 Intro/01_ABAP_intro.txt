ABAP:
    Is a programming language used to develop applications in SAP systems.
    ABAP (Allgemeiner Berichts Aufbereitungs Prozessor) means 'General Report-Consolidating Processor'
    'Processador de Criação de Relatórios Gerais', and an acronym for 'Advanced Business Application Programming'.
    Different from other languages, ABAP was specifically developed to be used only in SAP systems.

Role of an ABAP Consultant:
    Despite a good understanding of the business processes helps to code, it isn't absolutely necessary.
    As ABAP devs, we don't usually interact with end users directly.
    
    Functional consultants valuate the customer requirement and decide if it requires technical changes.
    If so, the functional Center of Excelence (CoE) assign a task to the ABAP CoE:
        Functional consultant:
            Prepare a functional requirement document explaining the requirement and listing
            all the essential information to make the changes needed in the application.
                e.g. User asks for some extra information to be shown in a report output:
                        the functional specification will provide the required information, such as:
                        name of the report
                        program that should be changed
                        database tables where the extra information can be found to show in the report output.
    Functional specification Received by the ABAP CoE is assigned to an ABAP consultant.
        ABAB consultant:
            Prepare a technical specification based on the functional specification:
                The technical specification capture the required changes from a technical perspective
            Make the necessary changes to the application.
            The application will be tested by the functional consultant and user in Quality Assurance environment.
    
    Typical work:
        Production support: Fixing bugs
        Enhancements: enhance the applciation to provide added functionality
        New projects: develop new applications
    
    Changing and Adapting Data Structure
        SAP software is delivered with standard SAP applications and configurations.
        However, every company may have its company-specific requirements:
            This is called 'customization'. There are 3 types:
                Modification:
                    Standard SAP is modified.
                    Modifications are lost when system is upgraded or support package is imported
                Customer enhancement:
                    Standard SAP applications are enhanced without changing the standard source code.
                    There are specific openings in the code where you can supplement the SAP standard system.
                        The enhancements aren't lost in a system upgrade.
                    SAP provides a variety of enhancements techniques:
                        User Exits / Customer Exits
                        Business Add-Ins (BAdIs)
                        ...
                    Not every standard SAP object can be enhanced.
                Customer development:
                    Customers develop own repository objects:
                        Tables
                        Programs
                        Transactions
                        ...
                    All objects created by a customer should start with Y or Z.

                                        Customization Overview

Types of applications:
    Typically includes:
        Reports
        Forms
        Interfaces
        Transactions
        ...
    ABAP supports both procedural and object-oriented programming.

RICEF:
    Acronym for different kind of objects developed in ABAP:
        Reports:
            Provides read-only acces to a database.
            ABAP was originally created mainly for creating reports (as the name suggests).
            During the reporting process, data is updated by transactions and processed by report programs:
                e.g. check available stock:
                    Report pull out this data and present it as a report output.

        Intefaces:
            Allow data exchange with other systems.
            Typically two kinds:
                
                Inbound interface programs:
                    Data is received from an external  system and updated in SAP.

                Outbound Interface Programs:
                    Data is extracted from SAP  and pushed to external systems.

        Conversions:
            Similar to inbound interface programs.
            Sap provides the tool Legacy System Migration Workbench (LSMW)

        Extensions:
            Programs that extends the funcionality of a standard SAP system.
            Includes: modifications, enhancements, new evelopments and third-party add-on programs.

        Forms:
            Similar to report programs, however provide more flexibility in layout design.
            Used with documents for which the user wants a physical version.
                e.g. purchase order, ...
            These documents should meet legal requirements and format.
            SAP provides various tools with ABAP Workbench:
                SAPscripts
                Smart forms
                Adobe forms
                ...
            A typical form layout contains various windows to print different data from the document.
            
Primitive  Data Types:
    Character-like Types:
        String:
            Any characters, arbitrary lenght.
        c:
            Any characters, fixed lenght (default = 1).
            e.g. DATA item_name TYPE c LENGHT 5.
        d:
            Date, YYYMMDD.
        t:
            Time, HHMMSS.
    Numeric types:
        i:
            Integer.
        p:
            Packed, decimals (default = 8).
