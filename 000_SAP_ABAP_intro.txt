ABAP (Allgemeiner Berichts Aufbereitungs Prozessor) means literally 'General Report-Consolidating Processor'
or 'Processador de Criação de Relatórios Gerais', also an acronym for 'Advanced Business Application Programming'.

ABAP is a programming language developed by SAP (Systeme, Anwendungen und Produkte in der Datenverarbeitung)
